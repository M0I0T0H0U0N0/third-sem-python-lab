#Develop python program to perform the below mentioned operations.
#a) display total marks scored by each student
#b) Display top scorer and the top score
#Scenario: There are 8 students and answers t o 10 multiple choice questions of each
#student is stored in a file called marks.txt. Each answer is delimited by space. Each line
#provides a studentâ€™s answers to the questions, as shown below.The answer key isstored in
#a file named keys.txt. The format of answer keys as shown below.
